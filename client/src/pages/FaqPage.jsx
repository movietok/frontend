        <div className="faq-item">
          <h2 className="faq-question">How accurate are the movie showtimes?</h2>
          <p className="faq-answer">
            Our showtimes are sourced directly from Finnkino's API and are updated in real-time. 
            However, we recommend double-checking the theater's website for last-minute changes, 
            especially for very popular releases or special screenings.

          <h2 className="faq-question">Where does the movie information come from?</h2>
          <p className="faq-answer">
            We source our movie data from TMDB (The Movie Database), one of the most comprehensive 
            and up-to-date movie databases available. This includes movie details, cast information, 
            posters, and basic ratings. User reviews and ratings on MovieTok are from our own community.

            Yes! MovieTok gives you full control over your privacy. You can choose what information is visible 
            on your profile, manage your group memberships, and control who can see your reviews and favorites.

          <h2 className="faq-question">How do movie groups work?</h2>
          <p className="faq-answer">
            Groups are spaces where you can connect with other movie fans who share your interests. You can create 
            groups for specific genres, directors, or even organize movie nights. Each group has its own favorites 
            list, discussion space, and member management tools.
